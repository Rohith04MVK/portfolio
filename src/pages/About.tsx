            My name is Rohith. 18 y/o developer from India, still consider
            myself new but always learning new things. I absolutely love to
            write code, and discuss code, and everything around code, haha. Got
            a knack for programming, and building those cool ML models you've
            always dreamt of. Journey been a crazy one, went from being scared
            by HTML to loving Machine learning in a single year, during the
            pandemic. The people I met on the way, the friendships made, lessons
            learned all this was a great adventure! ðŸ’™
